<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how and when This-App collects, uses, and shares your information when you use This-App, including our mobile applications and websites (the "Services"). This-App receives your information through our mobile applications, websites, email notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to use your information in, and as a result to transfer it to and store it in, the United States and any other country where we operate. Privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where you live.
</p>

        
             
<h3 id="support-or-contact">Information Collection</h3>

<p>
When you create a This-App account, you must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address and password or by authentication using another service, such as Google or Facebook. You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short bio, location, and profile picture. If you create your This-App account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your This-App profile. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile page.
</p>

<h3 id="support-or-contact">Contact Information</h3>

<p>
n addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. We may use the contact information (such as your phone number or email address) to help connect you with other This-App users, even if that information is not publicly displayed. Some contact information may be required in order to use certain Services. For example, you must have a verified phone number attached to your account in order to send a This-App Message to someone who does not follow you.
</p>

<h3 id="support-or-contact">Finding Friends and Connecting to Other Services</h3>

<p>
Our Services include several features to help connect you to the accounts of people you already know. For example, you may upload information from your address book or connect your This-App account to your account on another service such as Google or Facebook. This-App will match the information you provide with the contact information of other This-App users in order to provide and improve the Services, for example by making recommendations and routing This-App messages. You may remove address book data from This-App at any time through the settings in your This-App app. When you connect your This-App account to other services, you are able to post your Content to those services as well. You may disconnect your This-App account from your account on the other services at any time. Disconnecting your This-App account will immediately revoke our authorization to cross-post on your behalf or otherwise access that account and we will delete information obtained from that connection (other than information that was publicly posted on This-App, such as profile information), which may take some time.
</p>
        
<h3 id="support-or-contact">Location Information</h3>

<p>
n addition to profile information, you may also tell us your exact location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a video with a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content that has been tagged near your location.
</p>   

<h3 id="support-or-contact">Log Data</h3>

<p>
Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services,view videos hosted by This-App, or interact with our email notifications. This-App uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.
